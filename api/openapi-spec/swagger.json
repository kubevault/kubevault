Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n  a. No precision is lost\n  b. No fractional digits will be emitted\n  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n  1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\n  1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNOTE: We reserve the right to amend this canonical format, perhaps to\n  allow 1.5 to be canonical.\n  or after March 2015.\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.",
