# GCPRole 

## What is GCPRole

A `GCPRole` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition` (CRD) which allows a user to create a GCP secret engine role in a Kubernetes native way.

When a `GCPRole` is created, the KubeVault operator [configures](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/gcp/index.html#setup) a Vault roleset.
The rolesets determine the permissions that Service Account credentials generated by Vault will have on GCP resources. If the user deletes the `GCPRole` CRD, then the respective role will also be deleted from Vault.

For maintaining similarity with other secret engines we will refer **roleset as role** in the following description.

![GCPRole CRD](/docs/images/concepts/gcp_role.svg)

## GCPRole CRD Specification

Like any official Kubernetes resource, a `GCPRole` object has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta`, `Spec` and `Status` sections.

A sample `GCPRole` object is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: engine.kubevault.com/v1alpha1
kind: GCPRole
metadata:
  name: gcp-role
  namespace: demo
spec:
  vaultRef:
    name: vault-app
  secretType: access_token
  project: ackube
  bindings: 'resource "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/ackube" {
    roles = ["roles/viewer"]
    }'
  tokenScopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  phase: Success
```

> Note: To resolve the naming conflict, name of the role in Vault will follow this format: `k8s.{clusterName}.{metadata.namespace}.{metadata.name}`

Here, we are going to describe the various sections of the `GCPRole` crd.

### GCPRole Spec

GCPRole `spec` contains the necessary information required to create a GCP secret engine role.

```yaml
spec:
  vaultRef:
    name: <appbinding-name>
  path: <gcp-secret-engine-path>
  secretType: <generated-secret-type>
  project: <svc-ac-owner-project>
  bindings: <bindings>
  tokenScopes: <OAuth-scopes>
```

GCPRole spec has the following fields:

#### spec.vaultRef

`spec.vaultRef` is a `required` field that specifies the name of an [AppBinding](/docs/concepts/vault-server-crds/auth-methods/appbinding.md) reference which is used to connect with a Vault server. AppBinding must be on the same namespace with the GCPRole object.

```yaml
spec:
  vaultRef:
    name: vault-app
```

#### spec.path

`spec.path` is an `optional` field that specifies the path where the secret engine is enabled. The default path value is `gcp`.

```yaml
spec:
  path: my-gcp-path
```

#### spec.secretType

`spec.secretType` is a `required` field that specifies the type of secret generated for this roleset. Accepted values: `access_token`, `service_account_key`.

```yaml
spec:
  secretType: access_token
```

#### spec.project

`spec.project` is a `required` field that specifies the name of the GCP project where roleset's service account belongs to.

```yaml
spec:
  project: ackube
```

#### spec.bindings

`spec.bindings` is a `required` field that specifies the bindings configuration string.

```yaml
spec:
  bindings: 'resource "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/ackube" {
    roles = ["roles/viewer"]
    }'
```

#### spec.tokenScopes

`spec.tokenScopes` is an `optional` field that specifies the list of
OAuth scopes to assign to `access_token` secrets generated under this role
 set (`access_token` role sets only)

```yaml
spec:
  tokenScopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]
```

### GCPRole Status

`status` shows the status of the GCPRole. It is managed by the KubeVault operator. It contains the following fields:

- `observedGeneration`: Specifies the most recent generation observed for this resource. It corresponds to the resource's generation, which is updated on mutation by the API Server.

- `phase`: Indicates whether the role successfully applied to Vault or not.

- `conditions` : Represent observations of a GCPRole.
