# Mount Azure Secrets using CSI Driver

At first, you need to have a Kubernetes 1.16 or later cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/). To check the version of your cluster, run:

```console
$ kubectl version --short
Client Version: v1.21.2
Server Version: v1.21.1
```

Before you begin:

- Install KubeVault operator in your cluster from [here](/docs/setup/README.md).
- Install Secrets Store CSI driver for Kubernetes secrets in your cluster from [here](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/installation.html).
- Install Vault Specific CSI provider from [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-csi-provider)

To keep things isolated, we are going to use a separate namespace called `demo` throughout this tutorial.

```console
$ kubectl create ns demo
namespace/demo created
```

> Note: YAML files used in this tutorial stored in [examples](/docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure) folder in GitHub repository [KubeVault/docs](https://github.com/kubevault/kubevault)

## Vault Server

If you don't have a Vault Server, you can deploy it by using the KubeVault operator.

- [Deploy Vault Server](/docs/guides/vault-server/vault-server.md)

The KubeVault operator can manage policies and secret engines of Vault servers which are not provisioned by the KubeVault operator. You need to configure both the Vault server and the cluster so that the KubeVault operator can communicate with your Vault server.

- [Configure cluster and Vault server](/docs/guides/vault-server/external-vault-sever.md#configuration)

Now, we have the [AppBinding](/docs/concepts/vault-server-crds/auth-methods/appbinding.md) that contains connection and authentication information about the Vault server. And we also have the service account that the Vault server can authenticate.

```console
$ kubectl get appbinding -n demo
NAME    AGE
vault   50m

$ kubectl get appbinding -n demo vault -o yaml
apiVersion: appcatalog.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: AppBinding

```

## Enable & Configure Azure SecretEngine

### Enable Azure SecretEngine
```console
$ kubectl apply -f docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure/secretengine.yaml
secretengine.engine.kubevault.com/azure-engine created
```

### Create AzureRole
```console
$ kubectl apply -f docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure/secretenginerole.yaml
azurerole.engine.kubevault.com/azure-role created
```

Let's say pod's service account name is `test-user-account` located in `demo` namespace. We need to create a [VaultPolicy](/docs/concepts/policy-crds/vaultpolicy.md) and a [VaultPolicyBinding](/docs/concepts/policy-crds/vaultpolicybinding.md) so that the pod has access to read secrets from the Vault server.

### Create Service Account for Pod

Let's create the service account `test-user-account` which will be used in VaultPolicyBinding.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: test-user-account
  namespace: demo
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure/serviceaccount.yaml
serviceaccount/test-user-account created
```

### Create VaultPolicy and VaultPolicyBinding for Pod's Service Account
When a VaultPolicyBinding object is created, the KubeVault operator create an auth role in the Vault server. The role name is generated by the following naming format: `k8s.(clusterName or -).namespace.name`. Here, it is `k8s.-.demo.mysql-reader-role`. We need to provide the auth role name as service account `annotations` while creating the service account. If the annotation `secrets.csi.kubevault.com/vault-role` is not provided, the CSI driver will not be able to perform authentication to the Vault.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.kubevault.com/v1alpha1
kind: VaultPolicy
metadata:
  name: azure-reader-policy
  namespace: demo
spec:
  vaultRef:
    name: vault
  policyDocument: |
    path "your-azure-path/creds/*" {
      capabilities = ["read", "create"]
    }
---
apiVersion: policy.kubevault.com/v1alpha1
kind: VaultPolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-reader-role
  namespace: demo
spec:
  vaultRef:
    name: vault
  policies:
    - ref: azure-reader-policy
  subjectRef:
    kubernetes:
      serviceAccountNames:
        - "test-user-account"
      serviceAccountNamespaces:
        - "demo"
```

Let's create VaultPolicy and VaultPolicyBinding:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure/policy.yaml
vaultpolicy.policy.kubevault.com/azure-reader-policy created

$ kubectl apply -f docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure/policybinding.yaml
vaultpolicybinding.policy.kubevault.com/azure-reader-role created
```

Check if the VaultPolicy and the VaultPolicyBinding are successfully registered to the Vault server:

```console
$ kubectl get vaultpolicy -n demo
NAME                                 STATUS    AGE
azure-reader-policy                  Success   8s

$ kubectl get vaultpolicybinding -n demo
NAME                                 STATUS    AGE
azure-reader-role                    Success   10s
```

## Mount secrets into a Kubernetes pod

So, we can create `SecretProviderClass` now. You can read more about `SecretProviderClass` [here](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/concepts.html#secretproviderclass).

### Create SecretProviderClass

Create `SecretProviderClass` object with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: vault-db-provider
  namespace: demo
spec:
  provider: vault
  parameters:
    vaultAddress: "http://vault.demo:8200"
    roleName: "k8s.-.demo.azure-reader-role"
    objects: |
      - objectName: "client_id"
        secretPath: "your-azure-path/creds/k8s.-.demo.azure-role"
        secretKey: "client_id"
      - objectName: "client_secret"
        secretPath: "your-azure-path/creds/k8s.-.demo.azure-role"
        secretKey: "client_secret"
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure/secretproviderclass.yaml
secretproviderclass.secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/vault-db-provider created
```

### Create Pod

Now we can create a `Pod` to consume the `Azure` secrets. When the `Pod` is created, the `Provider` fetches the secret and writes them to Pod's volume as files. At this point, the volume is successfully mounted and the `Pod` starts running.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demo-app
  namespace: demo
spec:
  serviceAccountName: test-user-account
  containers:
    - image: jweissig/app:0.0.1
      name: demo-app
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      volumeMounts:
        - name: secrets-store-inline
          mountPath: "/secrets-store/azure-creds"
          readOnly: true
  volumes:
    - name: secrets-store-inline
      csi:
        driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
        readOnly: true
        volumeAttributes:
          secretProviderClass: "vault-db-provider"
```

```console
$ kubectl apply -f docs/examples/guides/secret-engines/azure/pod.yaml
pod/demo-app created
```
## Test & Verify

Check if the Pod is running successfully, by running:

```console
$ kubectl get pods -n demo
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo-app                   1/1     Running   0          11s
```

### Verify Secret

If the Pod is running successfully, then check inside the app container by running

```console
$ kubectl exec -it -n demo pod/demo-app -- /bin/sh
/ # ls /secrets-store/azure-creds
client_id client_secret

/ # cat /secrets-store/azure-creds/client_id
ya29.c.Kl20BwwWtb6DoTjY4-eSVgQQq.......

/ # cat /secrets-store/azure-creds/client_secret
ya29.c.Kl20BwwWtb6DoTjY4-eSVgQQq.......
/ # exit
```

So, we can see that the secret `client_id` and `client_secret` is mounted into the pod, where the secret key is mounted as file and value is the content of that file.

## Cleaning up

To clean up the Kubernetes resources created by this tutorial, run:

```console
$ kubectl delete ns demo
namespace "demo" deleted
```
